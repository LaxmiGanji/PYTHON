## Hello World

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
## Input AND Output
```python
#for char
a=input("enter character: ")
print(a)
#for int
a=int(input("enter the number: "))
print(a)
```
## Variable Assignment
```python
name = "laxmi"
age = 18
```
## Arithmetic Operations
```python
x = 9
y = 5

addition = x + y
subtraction = x - y
multiplication = x * y
division = x / y
#division without float values as output
div= x // y
```
## Conditional Statements
```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```
## Loops
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```
